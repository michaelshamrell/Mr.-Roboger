Describe: roboger loop

test:  a function that takes the user input and puts it into an array loop, defining the loop with "numbers", turning the input into a number variable
code: 
var robo = function(input) {
  let numbers = [];
}
expected output: when the user inputs a number the fuction(input) should run the numbers loop.

test : a for loop that calls on the input, starting at 0, then define the loop to run on any number greater than 0, then increase the value for each time the loop is executed.
code: 
for (let i = 0; i i <=input; i++)
expected output: the input has to be greater than 0,
